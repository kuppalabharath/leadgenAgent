LeadGen Agent

LeadGen Agent is not just a chatbot, it’s a smart lead-generating agent designed to interact naturally with users, provide accurate answers from your company’s knowledge base, and identify potential business opportunities. It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a vector database (VDB) to deliver precise, context-aware responses while capturing high-value leads based on user intent.

Key Features
	•	Context-Aware Responses – Uses FAISS and sentence-transformer embeddings to retrieve relevant information from your curated knowledge base, ensuring every answer is accurate and aligned with your company’s data.
	•	Intelligent Fallback – When a query goes beyond the knowledge base, the system smoothly transitions to LLaMA model for natural, open-ended conversation.
	•	Lead Detection & Capture – Analyzes user interactions to detect genuine interest and requests contact details only when intent signals a potential lead.
	•	Secure & Confidential – Delivers sensitive company and product information confidently, while storing lead data locally for safe follow-up or system integration.
	•	Cross-Device Accessibility – Works seamlessly across devices, keeping the conversation engaging wherever your users are.

How It Works
	1.	A user asks a question.
	2.	The agent searches the knowledge base via RAG for the most relevant context.
	3.	If context is found, it crafts an accurate, data-driven response.
	4.	If not, the agent falls back to the language model for a natural conversation.
	5.	When the interaction indicates real interest, the agent requests contact details and logs them securely for future engagement.

Why It’s Different

Unlike typical chatbots that only answer questions, LeadGen Agent is designed to generate value: it identifies potential leads, provides confidential and accurate company information, and ensures that every conversation contributes to business growth.
